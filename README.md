# Mikes Day Calendar

- We are creating a daily planner that will work through jQuery (Day.js)

- in this planner we will be able to modify any and each hour of the day for effective time management.

- When the app is opened it will display the current day

- each day will contain time blocks that can be modified, additionally these blocks will need to display if whether or not the time block is in the past, present, or future.

- When a time block is modified, it will be saved to the page upon reload.
