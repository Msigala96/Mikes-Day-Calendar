# Mikes Day Calendar

- In this assignment I was tasked with creating a day planner from scratch.
In the website you are able to add any tasks or things that need to be done through out the day into any of the given time blocks ranging from 9AM to 5PM. The pages header contains script that provides a real local time display of the day of the week, the date 00/00/0000, and real time 00:00:00 AM/PM.
When the save button is clicked, anything that was typed in the time blocks will be saved to local storage until changed. Even if you leave the site, anything you type will be saved!
I Used a lot of bootstrap through JavaScript in order to keep the HTML and CSS pages as short as possible, along with comments on the sections that required code in order to better understand.

## My Finished Work

- Link to the site:

- When a time block is modified, it will be saved to the page upon reload.
